# ## `labels`
#
# Collect all entities and labels and reorder according the labels:
#
#     kubecli labels NAME ...
#     kubectl get NAME ... \
#         -o custom-columns=NAMES:.metadata.name,LABELS:.metadata.labels
#
# This command can be useful to recognize labels for selectors when needs come to define what are the pods for logging.
#
# Besides that the new command reorders the collected list against the labels associating pods and other entities with the labels.
#

# Pass the arguments exactly in this order to prevent on overwriting our
# mandatory options by end users when they try to pass something another.
