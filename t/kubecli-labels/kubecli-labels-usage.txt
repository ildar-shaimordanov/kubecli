# ## `labels`
#
# Collect the entities and reorder against the labels they are associated:
#
#     kubecli labels NAME ...
#     kubectl get NAME ... \
#         --no-headers \
#         -o custom-columns=NAMES:.metadata.name,LABELS:.metadata.labels
#
# This command can be useful to recognize labels for selectors when needs come to define the pods for logging.
#
# Besides that this command reorders the collected list putting the labels in the front of the associated list of pods and other entities.

# Pass the arguments exactly in this order to prevent on overwriting our
# mandatory options by end users when they try to pass something another.
